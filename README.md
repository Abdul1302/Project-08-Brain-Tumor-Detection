# Project-08-Brain-Tumor-Detection

This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the classification of brain MRI images to detect brain tumors. The model is trained using a dataset of labeled brain MRI images and utilizes OpenCV as a core library for image processing.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Utilizing OpenCV for loading, preprocessing, and augmenting MRI images.
Model Architecture: A deep CNN specifically designed for medical image classification.
Training: Training the model on a labeled dataset of brain MRI images.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's accuracy and performance on a test dataset.
